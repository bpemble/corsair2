//! Dashboard snapshot publisher.
//!
//! Mirrors `src/snapshot.py`. Builds a single JSON payload at 4 Hz
//! containing the dashboard's view of the system: positions,
//! aggregated Greeks, kill state, hedge status, account values.
//! Written atomically via tempfile + rename.
//!
//! The Streamlit dashboard polls the snapshot file at the same
//! cadence — the boundary contract per spec §4.
