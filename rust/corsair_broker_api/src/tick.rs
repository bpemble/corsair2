//! Tick types — market data subscriptions and updates.
//!
//! The Broker delivers ticks for ALL active subscriptions on a single
//! broadcast channel. Consumers filter by `instrument_id`. For high-
//! volume subscriptions (full chain, many products) consider whether
//! the runtime should split this; for our ~60 strikes × 2 sides + 1
//! underlying the single channel is fine.
