        """Backfill any executions that happened while we were disconnected.

        ib_insync's `execDetailsEvent` only fires for executions that occur
        WHILE WE'RE CONNECTED — IBKR does not replay missed events on
        reconnect. Without this method, every fill that lands during a
        bootstrap window, restart, or watchdog reconnect is silently invisible
        to fill_handler: the position appears (because seed_from_ibkr pulls
        the post-fill book) but `fills_today`, `spread_capture_today`, and
        the realized-P&L attribution are all dark for that fill.

        Called once after FillHandler construction (in main.py) and after
        each successful watchdog reseed (in watchdog.py). Dedup by execId
        against `_seen_exec_ids`, which is itself persisted across restarts
        via daily_state.json — so calling this multiple times within a
        session is safe and idempotent.

        Returns the number of new fills replayed (for logging).
