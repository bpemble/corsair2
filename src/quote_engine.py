        per cycle by `_build_our_prices_index`. The cached entry is the same
        Trade *instance* that ib_insync mutates in place, so reading its
        `.orderStatus.status` always returns the latest value even between
        cache rebuilds.

        Cold path: when the cache is empty (e.g., a caller outside the
        update_quotes / get_active_quotes flow), fall back to walking
        openTrades. This preserves correctness if the call site changes.

        Why we don't cache the placeOrder return value: ib_insync sometimes
        constructs a NEW Trade object when an openOrder callback fires
        (notably after reqAutoOpenOrders adopts the order on clientId=0).
        The Trade returned by placeOrder becomes an orphan that nobody
        updates — it'd stay at PendingSubmit forever. The fix is to always
        re-resolve from the canonical store.

        Subtlety: openTrades() can return MULTIPLE Trade objects with the
        same orderId — the original (stale) Trade and a fresh one from the
        openOrder callback. We MUST return the LAST match in the iteration
