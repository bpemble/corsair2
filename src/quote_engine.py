        orderStatusEvent (evict on terminal). Reading the cached
        Trade returns the live ib_insync instance, so its

        the first update_quotes cycle) or the orderId genuinely isn't
        in our cache, seed from openTrades and try once more. After
        seeding, the cache is authoritative.

        Why we don't cache the placeOrder return value directly:
        ib_insync sometimes constructs a NEW Trade object when an
        openOrder callback fires (notably after reqAutoOpenOrders
        adopts the order on clientId=0). The Trade returned by
        placeOrder becomes an orphan that nobody updates — it'd stay
        at PendingSubmit forever. The openOrderEvent handler updates
        the cache to the canonical Trade once the ack arrives.

        Subtlety: openTrades() can return MULTIPLE Trade objects with
        the same orderId — the original (stale) Trade and a fresh one
        from the openOrder callback. We MUST return the LAST match in
        the iteration (the canonical one with up-to-date status), not
