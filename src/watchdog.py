"""Connection + data-freshness watchdog with auto-recovery.

Detects three failure modes that the in-process error handlers can't catch:
  1. ib.isConnected() returning False (TCP-level loss)
  2. Underlying tick stale beyond threshold (silent feed death)
  3. All option ticks stale (per-strike subscription hang)

On sustained unhealthy state (2 consecutive failures, ~20s) the watchdog
tears down the IB connection and rebuilds it from scratch: reconnect,
re-discover, re-subscribe, reseed positions, clear the disconnect kill so
quoting resumes. Risk-induced kills (margin/delta/PnL) stay sticky and
require human review — those signal a real problem, not a transient.

Also exposes :func:`safe_discover_and_subscribe`, a hard-timeout wrapper
around the discovery path used by both the watchdog recovery loop and
the startup retry loop in main.py.

# compose up -d ib-gateway``.

# We do NOT do a simple container.restart() first — empirical evidence shows
# the gateway hang is almost always caused by IBC session-state corruption
# in the named volume, which a process restart inside the same container
# can't clear. Skipping straight to the full recreate is faster and more
# reliable than trying the lighter intervention first.
