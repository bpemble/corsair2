"""Trader-side quote-decision logic (Option B per mm_service_split).

Independent implementation that *intends* to match the broker's quote
engine. Not a refactor of the broker's path — purposefully separate so
parity drift is the signal we measure.

Phase 6: ``decide`` delegates to the Rust ``corsair_pricing.decide_quote``
when the model is SABR. SVI and any unforeseen model fall back to the
pure-Python path below. The Python fallback also serves as the parity
reference for tests.

Inputs come from forwarded events: option price book, vol surface,
underlying. Outputs a structured decision per (strike, expiry, right,
side):

    {"action": "place" | "skip",
     "side": "BUY" | "SELL",
     "strike": float, "expiry": str, "right": str,
     "price": float | None,
     "theo": float | None,
     "iv": float | None,
     "reason": str}

What the broker does that we *don't* yet model (deliberate v2 simplifications):
    - peer-consensus cap engagement
    - inventory imbalance gates
    - layer-c cooldown
    - modify-storm guard
    - GTD lifetime / minimum-order-lifetime guards
    - active_orders incumbency (we'd amend if already resting)
