"""Trader process entry point.

Phase 1+2 scope:
  - Connect to broker IPC.
  - Receive every event the broker forwards.
  - Maintain a per-symbol price book + active-orders index from order acks.
  - Log every event to ``logs-paper/trader_events-YYYY-MM-DD.jsonl`` with
    a receive-side timestamp, so we can measure IPC latency offline
    (broker stamps ts_ns at emit; trader stamps recv_ns on receipt).
  - Periodic telemetry back to broker (event counts, IPC latency p50/p99).

NOT in this scope:
  - Quoting decisions (Phase 2c)
  - placeOrder commands (Phase 3)

Run: ``python3 -m src.trader.main``. Container command in
``docker-compose.yml``.
