        """Connect to IBKR Gateway with a minimal bootstrap.

        ib_insync's stock IB.connectAsync issues a long list of initializing
        requests in parallel after the API handshake (positions, open orders,
        completed orders, executions, account updates, *and* per-sub-account
        multi-account updates for every account on the login). On a paper
        login with 6 sub-accounts and a heavy overnight order history this
        bootstrap consistently times out — completed orders alone can take
        60+ seconds because IB Gateway is also processing them internally.

        We replace it with a hand-rolled bootstrap that issues only the four
        requests we actually need:

          1. client.connectAsync       — TCP/API handshake
          2. reqPositionsAsync         — to seed our position book
          3. reqOpenOrdersAsync        — to know what's resting from prior runs
          4. reqAccountUpdatesAsync    — for cash/margin/balance state

        Skipped vs the stock bootstrap:
          - reqCompletedOrdersAsync         (we never read completed orders;
                                             openTrades comes from reqOpenOrders)
          - reqExecutionsAsync              (deferred — see note below)
          - reqAccountUpdatesMultiAsync × N (we trade in exactly one account)
          - reqAutoOpenOrders               (we match orders by orderRef, not bind)

        IMPORTANT — reqExecutions backfill happens AFTER bootstrap, not as
        part of it. We can't skip it entirely: `execDetailsEvent` only fires
        for executions that occur while we're connected, and IBKR does not
        replay missed events on reconnect. Any fill that lands during a
        bootstrap window, restart, or watchdog reconnect would otherwise be
        invisible to fill_handler — the position appears via reqPositions
        but fills_today / spread_capture / daily_pnl are all dark for it.
        FillHandler.replay_missed_executions() does the backfill from
        main.py and the watchdog reseed paths, dedup'd against a persisted
        seen-execId set in daily_state.json. **Do not delete it.**

        This brings the connect from ~33-90s down to ~3-5s in the steady state
        and eliminates the failure modes where any single bloat request times
        out and breaks the whole gather.

        Codes:
          1100 — Connectivity between IBKR and TWS has been lost
          1300 — TWS socket port has been reset
        Both mean: stop trading, cancel everything, wait for restoration.

          1101 — Connectivity restored, data lost (need to resubscribe)
          1102 — Connectivity restored, data maintained
        These will be picked up by the watchdog reconnect path; we don't
        need to do anything special here beyond noting them.
